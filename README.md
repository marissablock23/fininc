Financial Inclusion and Mobile Money

This project aims to explore data on financial inclusion and mobile money, primarily in developing countries.

Financial inclusion means that households and businesses can access financial products and services for day-to-day spending, long-term planning, or emergencies. At the most basic level, financial inclusion enables access to an account to use for payments and savings. Shifting payments (for work, agricultural goods, remittances, government transfers, etc.) from cash into accounts can improve efficiency and convenience. Similarly, accounts for savings can provide safety from theft, but also curb impulse spending. Additionally, financial inclusion also incorporates access to credit and insurance. Ultimately, reliable access to finance can serve to reduce poverty by enabling individuals to invest in health, education, and their livelihoods. Evidence at the micro-level from various interventions supports this claim, although for microcredit the evidence is mixed.

Technology has been instrumental in improving access to finance, namely mobile money and digital payments, so I expect that a subset of the visualizations will focus on this aspect. East Africa, and Kenya in particular, have been at the forefront of mobile money. Mobile money allows for easy and safe transfers of resources among households and individuals and has significantly reduced transaction costs. Mobile money has also been used part of a response to humanitarian crises. For example, in Jordan, the central bank has created Jordan Mobile Payments, a national centralized payment switch that connects end users through their mobile phones to a payment ecosystem. This mobile wallet could provide significant benefits for Syrian refugees.
