# Financial Access Survey, IMF
Technology has been instrumental in improving access to finance, namely mobile money and digital payments. East Africa, and Kenya in particular, have been at the forefront of mobile money. Mobile money allows for easy and safe transfers of resources among households and individuals and has significantly reduced transaction costs.

Finance may be considered a constraint to economic growth if it's supply is constrained relative to demand. One means of understanding this is by analyzing the cost of finance, as measured by the real interest rate. A high interest rate, indicates a high cost of finance. A high cost of finance could be the result of low savings or costly intermediation. If low savings is the culprit, then we would expect that countries with a high interest rate also have a low savings, which is measured here as the number of depositors with commerical banks per 1,000 adults. A large number of depositors may indicate a large portion of savings.

Below, we see Mongolia has a very high interest rate and a small number of depositors. Thus, one might conclude that low savings is causing the high cost of finance. Brazil also has a very high interest rate, but the number of depositors is not quite as small as Mongolia. In contrast, Singapore (SGP), the interest rate is not very high, and there are a large number of depositors, indicating that finance is not a constraint to the economy.

Kenya leads the way in mobile money, while in some countries, like Ethiopia, mobile money has not taken off. 


## Financial Access Survey

The following charts utilize the 2015-16 Financial Access Survey from Kenya.

Access to finance for entrepreneurs is a key ingredient to economic growth. When small-to-medium enterprises, which are characteristic of Kenya, can access financial services, these business can save, invest, and ultimately grow. Yet, surprisingly, few business owners use these services.
```{r, warning = FALSE}
finac.k.15 %>%
  filter(!is.na(l11_1)) %>%
  group_by(l11_1) %>%
  mutate(bank = "Account at a bank") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(bank), fill = as.factor(l11_1))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Oranges", name = NULL, labels = c("Currently use", "Used to use", "Never used")) +
  labs(
    title = "An overwhelming majority of Kenyan business-owners have never used a bank account",
    subtitle = "At least for business purposes",
    caption = "Source: Financial Acces Survey, 2015-2016, Kenya",
    x = NULL
  )
```

Rather than taking out loans, Kenyan business owners tend to utilize their own personal savings to start their business. This could be a result of a number of issues, including a high interest rates or the inability of the financial sector to appropriately access risk.

Looking beyond business owners, Kenyans utilize all sorts of financial services. Although many business-owners do not use bank accounts for business purposes, most individuals living in urban areas do use bank accounts. However, the difference in access between urban males and females is significantly different, as is the difference between rural males and females.
